        This page will cover Flexboxes
    </p>

    <p>
        Flexbox is a way to arrange items into rows or columns
    </p>

    <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="one"></div>
        <div class="two"></div>
        <div class="three"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Flex container is an element with
        <strong>display: flex</strong> property. 
        A flex item is any element that lives directly inside a flex container.
        An element can be both flex container and flex item. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Nesting will be especially important for building complex layouts
    </p>
    <p>
        the <strong>flex</strong> property is a shorthand, a combination of flex-grow, 
        flex-shrink and flex-basis
    </p>
    <img src="flex.png">
    <h1>flex-grow</h1>
    <p>
        Defines the flex item's growth factor. On the upper example, every element has
        flex: 1; which means a flex-grow of 1, so the elements size will be the same.
        In the example below, the flex-grow property is 2 for the middle element, so its twice as big
    </p>

    <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="one"></div>
        <div class="twobig"></div>
        <div class="three"></div>
    </div>

    <h1>flex-shrink</h1>
    <p>
        Defines the flex item's shrink factor. A flex 1;  means a flex-shrink of 1, 
        so the elements size will be the same (default).
        flex-shrink only ends up being applied if the size of all flex items is 
        larger than their parent container. For example, if our 3 divs from above had a 
        width declaration like: width: 100px, and .flex-container was smaller than 300px, 
        our divs would have to shrink to fit.
    </p>

    <div class="flex-container_toshrink">
        <div class="one"></div>
        <div class="twosmall"></div>
        <div class="three"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="one"></div>
        <div class="two"><p style="text-align:center; padding: 20px; font-weight: bold;">For measure</p></div>
        <div class="three"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
        It can be seen, that flex-grow and flex-shrink does not respect width, The elements
        can grow to fit or shrink to fit.
    </p>

    <h1>flex-basis</h1>
    <p>
        flex-basis simply sets the initial size of a flex item,
        so any sort of flex-growing or flex-shrinking starts from that baseline size.
        The reason we had to change it to auto before, is that with the default 0%, the elements would
        ignore widths and shrink evenly. Using auto we told the item to check for a width declaration
        which is 400px in this case
    </p>

    <h3>
        Importance in shorthand
    </h3>
    <p>
        flex: 1; means flex 1 1 0%; <br>To use auto, we must either specify it separately, or use
        flex: 1 1 auto, or use flex: auto which translates to flex: 1 1 auto;
    </p>

    <h3>
        In practice
    </h3>
    <p>
        Most likely the flex: x; will be used mostly, and flex-shrink: 0; to avoid shrinking
    </p>
