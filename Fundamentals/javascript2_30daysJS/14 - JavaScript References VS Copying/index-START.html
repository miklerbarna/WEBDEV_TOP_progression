			// start with strings, numbers and booleans
			//Copy works with a simple '='

			let age = 18;
			let age2 = age;
			console.log(age, age2);
			age = 20;
			console.log(age, age2);

			let name = "tom";
			let name2 = name;
			console.log(name, name2);
			name = "Dan";
			console.log(name, name2);

			// Let's say we have an array
			const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

			const team = players;
			console.log(players, team);
			team[3] = "Lux"; //changes in players as well
			console.log(players, team);
			// and we want to make a copy of it.

			// You might think we can just do something like this:

			// however what happens when we update that array?

			// now here is the problem!

			// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

			// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

			// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
			// one way
			const team2 = players.slice(); //no arguments
			console.log(team2);
			team2[0] = "Daniel"; //players didnt change
			console.log(team2);
			console.log(players);

			// or create a new array and concat the old one in
			const team3 = [].concat(players);
			// or use the new ES6 Spread
			const team4 = [...players];

			//or Array.from()
			const team5 = Array.from(players);
			// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

			// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

			// with Objects
			const person = {
				name: "Wes Bos",
				age: 80,
			};

			// and think we make a copy:
			const captain = person;
			captain.age = 99; //person.age changes too
			console.log(captain, person);
			// how do we take a copy instead?
			const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 101, number: 2022 });
			console.log(captain2, person);
			// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

			// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
