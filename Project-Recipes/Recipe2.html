            The Seaweed
        </h3>
        <p>
            To get started, you need the right kind of <strong>seaweed</strong>.
            Make sure you get seaweed specific for sushi-making,
            which it should state on the package.
            <br>
            Spread the seaweed with a layer of prepared <strong>sushi rice</strong>,
            and flatten gently with a rice paddle
        </p>

            How to cut raw fish for sushi
        </h3>
        <p>
            Here is how I cut <strong>salmon</strong> for my sushi rolls.
            First, cut straight down through the filet,
            then cut that piece in half through the center so you have a small strip.
        </p>
        <h3>
            The <em>ROLL</em>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Place your desired ingredients onto the rice.
            Roll it up tightly, using a <strong>bamboo mat</strong>. 
            It’s a specific kitchen item, but you can get a decent one for 
            less than $2 on Amazon, so I think it’s worth having.
            If you don’t have one, you can sort of use parchment paper 
            or plastic wrap, but you won’t be able to wrap it as tightly, 
            so buy one if you plan to make sushi regularly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then use a sharp knife to cut the sushi roll into pieces.
            I don’t find it particularly better to use a serrated knife.
            Just make sure to use a sharp one!
