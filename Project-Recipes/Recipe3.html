    <h1>This is a simple, filling oatmeal recipe</h1>

    <p>
        There’s no secret that I love my oatmeal — especially after a 
        tough morning workout. 
        The secret to my oatmeal is that I make sure to add adequate healthy fat 
        and protein so that it’s a balanced and satisfying meal that powers me 
        for the day. The addition of the healthy fat and protein also helps to 
        promote muscle recovery and balanced blood sugar as well.
        Try serving this oatmeal with four to six ounces of your 
        favorite protein smoothie for an even more balanced and pro-recovery meal.
